# Bitmap-Images-Parser

This Python program parse a Bitmap Image passed by input, returning its metadata.\
It requires you to pass by input the absolute path of the image.\
<ins>This program is a sketch</ins>, made in 3 days, it's not optimized nor fully functional, <ins>but many changes will be made</ins>.\
It does not control input errors etcetera, but by time this program will have all the functionalities.\
For now it supports Bitmap files that have the **BITMAPCOREHEADER** and the **BITMAPINFOHEADER**.\
Inside the directory you can find two images with whom you can test the program.\
Those are the main sources / documentation that i used for the realisation of this program (They are really good):\
